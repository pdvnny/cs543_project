# Review

- [X] How did we define vertex cover in class?
- [ ] Should I be working on vertex cover, maximal matching, or am I misunderstanding the assignment?

# Next Steps

- [ ] Implement vertex cover approach from lecture ()

- [ ] Determine if vertex cover needs to absolutely cover all vertices in the graph
  - Is there a maximal vertex cover vs. a vertex cover?
- [ ] Research a sublinear time vertex cover algo
